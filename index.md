## Favourite cpsc 120l labs

* Lab 7, part-1

    In this lab I learned how to use requirements in code. I employed “and” and “or” statements to give specific return values for when requirements were made. I enjoyed using a real world problem like parking because it allowed me to use real world problem solving on how I would create a system that allows or denies access.

* Lab 9, part-1

    In this lab I learned how to use files more in depth. I also grew more accustomed to knowing how vectors work in this lab. Taking what is in the file then storing it in a vector was mainly what I took from the project. But I enjoyed the idea of working with files more and the possible career opportunities that focus on it.

* Lab 6, part-2

    This lab was my favourite lab of the rest. I created black jack and it was like creating a game so I felt intrigued. I struggled a lot but through it learned how a function works in my own way. It also inspired me to fully create a black jack game. Additionally it peaked my interest on computer science as a whole.
